# W(hat)TF?!

VFDL (is going to be) the equivalent of a hardware description language like VHDL for factorio.  You
define your factory in a very [VHDL-esque format](examples/green_circuit.vfdl), compile it using
vfdlc (this repo!) and get out a blueprint (book?) of that factory that you can paste.

# W(hy)TF?!

Because I can. And because I never ever want to ever have to build a 120:64 balancer by hand again.
And because I want to automate signal logic away (TODO). And because I want to be able to compile
MIDI to programmable speaker (TODO).

# W(hence)TF?!

Do you mean "how"? In that case: magic. Pure, raw, unadultered, black magic.

# I WANNA USE THIS! THIS IS COOL!

It doesn't work yet. It may in the future. But it doesn't at the moment.
